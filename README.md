# Bigmart-sales-prediction
The aim of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to 
understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales. Using this predictive model, the Bigmart will be able to focus more on the 
products which have high sales and figure out which products have low sales to understand that issue as well.
